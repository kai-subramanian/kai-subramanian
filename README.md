# H1 âš¡More About Me

I am a passionate, result-oriented, and smard working developer. No, I didn't make any typo with smard; it's my way of doing a portmanteau of smart and hard. I am like that - quirky, weird and wonderful ðŸ˜„ I have a pragmatic and unique way of looking at technological endeavours; I personally believe that coding is an art. 

Much like my role-model and hero Steve Jobs, I believe that spectacular events happen at the intersection of art and technology ðŸ˜Š. I am a huge proponent of zen design, in all tenets of technology. My ambition is to contribute to a game-changing digital product / service that promises to simplify and ameliorate people's lives.
